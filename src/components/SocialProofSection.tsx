// REMOVED: SocialProofSection component
//
// This component contained fake testimonials and user reviews for a pre-launch application.
// Since HealthScan hasn't launched yet and has no actual users, displaying testimonials
// from "actual app testers and beta users" would be misleading and inappropriate.
//
// The component included:
// - Fake testimonials from fictional users
// - Misleading stats like "4.9 Average Rating" and "Products Scanned"
// - Claims about user experiences that don't exist yet
//
// This section should only be re-added after the app launches and actual user
// feedback is collected from real users.

export function SocialProofSection() {
  return null; // Component disabled for pre-launch
