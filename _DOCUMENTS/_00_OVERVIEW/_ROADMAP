# Workspace Roadmap

## Active Briefs

### B0_FILE_CLEANUP (Current)

- **Goal**: Restore mandatory documentation, ensure required directories exist, clean unused files, and verify waitlist health (functionality + metrics).
- **Milestones**:

  1. Documentation baseline recreated (`_CONTEXT`, `_ROADMAP`, `B0_*` files).
  2. Workspace audit (structure validation, missing folders, removal of redundant assets/code).
  3. Waitlist verification (functional test plan executed, Supabase data reviewed, user count reported).

- **Key Risks**:

  - Outdated Supabase credentials/env vars.
  - Hidden broken imports/components while cleaning unused files.
  - Lack of automated tests around waitlist edge cases.

- **Next Deliverables**:

  - Document cleanup findings + waitlist metrics in `B0_CHECKLIST`.
  - Provide remediation plan if Supabase data cannot be queried locally.

## Backlog / Future Briefs

1. **B1_WAITLIST_ENHANCEMENTS** *(placeholder)*: Enhanced verification flow, referral analytics, spam protection.
2. **B2_MOBILE_HANDOFF** *(placeholder)*: Deep linking + native share improvements.
3. **B3_EMAIL_CUSTOMIZER** *(placeholder)*: In-app template editor and A/B testing tooling.

## Operational Checklist

- Confirm `.env` contains Supabase + API keys (never commit).
- Run automated tests (unit + integration) before merging.
- Keep design assets synced inside `src/assets` with clear naming.
- Update `B{N}_CHECKLIST` after each meaningful change.
- Follow commit naming + branch rules outlined in `_CONTEXT`.
