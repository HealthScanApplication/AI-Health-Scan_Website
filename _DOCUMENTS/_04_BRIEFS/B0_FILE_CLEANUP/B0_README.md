# B0 • File Cleanup & Waitlist Verification

## Objective

Re-establish workspace standards (documentation + folder structure), remove unnecessary files, and confirm the waitlist system is operational with a current user count.

## Scope

1. Regenerate mandatory documentation stack (`_CONTEXT`, `_ROADMAP`, `B0_*`).
2. Audit project structure for missing required folders or stray files.
3. Execute cleanup tasks (delete obsolete assets, ensure naming consistency).
4. Validate waitlist functionality end-to-end and report Supabase user totals.

## Key Deliverables

- Updated `_DOCUMENTS` hierarchy populated with B0 files.
- Checklist documenting structure compliance + cleanup decisions.
- Evidence of waitlist testing (manual steps + automated checks if available).
- Reported waitlist user count and data source (Supabase table or API call).

## Success Criteria

- No outstanding markdownlint or structural violations in documentation.
- Repository contains required directories/assets defined in workspace standards.
- Waitlist signup/referral flow demonstrably works in dev environment.
- Clear metrics for total waitlist users (or documented blocker preventing retrieval).
